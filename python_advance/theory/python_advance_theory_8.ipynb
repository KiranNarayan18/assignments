    "\n",
    "__cause__: This constraint is used to specify the cause of the exception, which can be another exception that caused the current one. This constraint is useful when you want to provide more context about the reason for the exception, and it can help with debugging and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "__context__: This constraint is used to specify the context of the exception, which can be another exception that is being handled. This constraint is useful when you want to chain exceptions together, so that the original exception is preserved and can be traced back to its source."

    "\n",
    "Subclassing an exception and overriding the __str__ method: Another way to specify the text of an exception object's error message is to define a custom exception class that subclasses the appropriate base exception class (e.g. Exception, ValueError, etc.), and override the __str__ method to return a custom error message."

    "##### Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of type checking: Since string-based exceptions don't have a specific type or class associated with them, it's difficult to perform any kind of type checking or catch specific types of exceptions. This can make it harder to handle errors in a predictable and robust way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of traceback information: When a string-based exception is raised, the traceback information that's generated by Python is less informative and harder to use for debugging purposes. This can make it harder to track down the source of an error and fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion with string literals: Since string-based exceptions are just string literals, it's easy to accidentally raise an exception by including a string literal in your code that's not intended to be an error. This can lead to confusion and make it harder to identify the actual errors in your code."
