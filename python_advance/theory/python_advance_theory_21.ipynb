    "##### Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes or events in a random process. In other words, it tells us how probable it is to observe different values of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the values of a random variable are unpredictable, the probability distribution provides us with information about the likelihood of different outcomes. This allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the random variable over many trials or observations"

    "\n",
    "Yes, there is a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for many applications because they exhibit statistical properties that are similar to true random numbers, such as uniform distribution, independence, and unpredictability."

    "\n",
    "In short term probability distribution is un-predictable\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, as the number of trials increases, the probability distribution becomes more tightly clustered around its expected values, and the variability of the results decreases. This is why larger sample sizes are generally preferred in statistical analysis, as they provide more reliable estimates of the underlying probabilities or parameters."
