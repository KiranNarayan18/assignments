    "##### Q1. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files are human-readable files that store data in the form of lines of text, typically encoded in ASCII or Unicode. They can be opened and modified with a text editor or a program that can read and manipulate text.\n",
    "\n",
    "binary files store data in a format that is not human-readable. Binary files are typically used for storing data that cannot be represented as text, such as images, audio, video, or compiled code. "

    "\n",
    "Text files are generally preferred for storing data that is human-readable or can be easily converted to human-readable form, such as plain text, CSV, or JSON files. They are also useful for storing configuration files, code, and other types\n",
    "\n",
    " if you are working with large datasets or complex data structures, a binary file format like HDF5 or Parquet may be more efficient than a text-based format like CSV or JSON."

    "##### Q3. What are some of the issues with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disc?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Endianness: Different computer architectures use different byte orders to store integers. If you write an integer in one byte order and try to read it in another byte order, you will get a completely different number. To avoid this issue, you need to convert the byte order before reading or writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Platform dependencies: Binary files are highly platform-dependent. If you write a binary file on one platform and try to read it on another platform with a different architecture, you may encounter compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data type: Binary files are not human-readable, and you need to have prior knowledge of the data type and format to read or write them. This means that binary files are not suitable for sharing data between different programming languages or systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Portability: Binary files are not portable across different operating systems or file systems. If you need to share data between different systems, you may need to convert the binary data into a more portable format, such as a text file or a JSON file."

    "\n",
    "The struct package is used to interpret binary data and convert it to a format that can be used in Python. It is used when dealing with low-level binary data such as network packets, binary file formats, and other binary data formats. Therefore, it is commonly used in systems programming, network programming, and data serialization applications, where binary data is transmitted and received. If you are working with binary data in your Python applications, you may find yourself using the struct package frequently.\n"
