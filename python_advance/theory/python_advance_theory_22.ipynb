    "\n",
    "1. Limited functionality: The array package provides a limited set of functions for manipulating arrays, compared to more advanced data structures like NumPy arrays. For example, arrays cannot be reshaped, transposed, or sliced in the same way as NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limited data types: The array package supports only a limited set of data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, and characters. This means that it may not be suitable for all types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No vectorized operations: The array package does not provide vectorized operations like NumPy arrays, which can perform operations on entire arrays at once. Instead, operations on arrays must be performed element-wise using loops or list comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. No support for multidimensional arrays: The array package only supports one-dimensional arrays, which can limit its usefulness for certain applications."
