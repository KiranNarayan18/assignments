    "##### Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data."

    "##### Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python searches for an attribute in an upward tree of attributes. Tt first searches for the attribute in its instance and then looks in the class it is generated from, to all super classes listed in its class header."

    "##### Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class object is a blueprint for creating instances of the class, while an instance object is a specific instance of a class that has its own unique state. In Python, a class is defined using the \"class\" keyword, and an instance is created by calling the class name as a function. For example:\n",

    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "my_instance = MyClass()\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, the first argument in a class method is typically named \"self\". This argument represents the instance of the class on which the method is called. It gives the method access to the attributes and methods of the class and allows the method to modify the state of the instance."

    "\n",
