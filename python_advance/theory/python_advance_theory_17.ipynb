    "\n",
    "Greedy syntax attempts to match as much input as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match, while non-greedy (or lazy) syntax matches as little input as possible. To make a greedy pattern non-greedy, you can add a \"?\" after the repetition operator (+ or ) to create a lazy version of the pattern. "

    "\n",
    "In a simple match of a string that only looks for one match and does not do any replacement, the use of a nontagged group is unlikely to make any practical difference. A nontagged group is a group of parentheses that do not contain a tag (a question mark followed by one of several letters). These groups are used to group part of a pattern together, but they do not capture the matched text. Since they do not capture any text, using a nontagged group instead of a regular group (which does capture the matched text) is not likely to have any impact on the outcome of a simple string match."

    "A scenario in which using a nontagged category would have a significant impact on the program's outcomes is when working with large text files and performing multiple search and replace operations. If the regular expression pattern includes multiple tagged categories, the Python regular expression engine will capture and store every match. This can result in an excessive amount of memory usage, causing the program to slow down or even crash if the text file is very large. By using nontagged categories instead, the regular expression engine will skip capturing and storing the matches, resulting in faster and more memory-efficient processing."

    "Consider a scenario where you want to find all occurrences of a word that are followed by a specific punctuation mark, but you do not want to include the punctuation mark in the match. If you use a normal regex pattern to find the word followed by the punctuation mark, the punctuation mark would be consumed by the match, and you would have to remove it afterwards. However, by using a look-ahead condition, you can examine the character after the word without consuming it, and only include the word in the match. This can save time and make the code more efficient, especially if you are working with large datasets.\n"
