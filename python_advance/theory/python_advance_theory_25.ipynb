    "\n",
    "The fundamental distinction between a numpy array and a pandas dataframe is that numpy arrays are homogeneous, whereas pandas dataframes are heterogeneous. Numpy arrays are a collection of elements of the same data type, such as integers or floats, arranged in a grid of rows and columns. In contrast, a pandas dataframe is a two-dimensional labelled data structure with columns of varying data types, such as integers, floats, strings, or even other dataframes."

Additionally, it may be helpful to use data cleaning and filtering techniques to remove missing or inaccurate data. Furthermore, it's a good idea to provide users with options to choose from a list of available ticker symbols to avoid invalid input."

The legend typically lists the symbols, colors, or patterns used in the chart, along with a label or description of what they represent. "
