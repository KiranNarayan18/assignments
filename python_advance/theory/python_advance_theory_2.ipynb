    "\n",
    "A module can contain one or more classes. Classes are defined in a module, and the module provides a namespace for the class, so that the class name does not conflict with other class names in the program."

    "##### Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a class in Python, you use the class keyword, followed by the class name, a colon, and the class body. The class body contains the methods and attributes of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "In Python, class attributes are created inside the class definition and should be defined at the top level, outside of any methods. They are shared among all instances of the class and are usually used to store information that is associated with the class as a whole, such as default values for instance attributes or global state for the cla"

    "In Python, instance attributes are created inside the class definition, usually in the class constructor method __init__ and they are specific to each instance of the class. They store information that is unique to each instance, such as the state or properties of the object."

    "\n",
    "The term \"self\" is used to refer to the instance of a class on which a method is being called. It is a convention to use \"self\" as the first parameter of a class's method.\n",
    "It is the instance that is being operated on and it's passed automatically when the method is called on an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an instance of a class and call one of its methods, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method. This argument is typically called \"self\" by convention. Inside the method, \"self\" refers to the instance on which the method is being called."

    "##### Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, operator overloading allows you to define how operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, etc.) work on objects of a class. This allows you to define custom behavior for operators when they are used on instances of your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overload an operator, you need to define a special method in your class with a specific name. For example, to overload the + operator, you would define a method named __add__."

These special methods have names that begin and end with double underscores, such as __add__, __sub__, __mul__, __truediv__, etc."
