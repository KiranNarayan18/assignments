    "\n",
    "One situation where it might be beneficial to use multiple import statements for the same module is when working with a large library that contains many submodules. In such cases, you might want to import specific functions or classes from different submodules of the library, and using multiple import statements can make it easier to refer to those functions or classes without having to specify the full path to the module every time."

These definitions and statements can include variables, functions, classes, and other objects that can be used in other Python programs or modules. Another characteristic of a module is that it can be imported into other Python programs or modules using the import statement. Once a module is imported, its definitions and statements can be accessed and used in the importing program or module."

When a module is imported, its __name__ attribute is set to the name of the module, but if the module is run as the main program, its __name__ attribute is set to the string '__main__'. This can be useful to conditionally execute code depending on whether the module is being run as the main program or being imported as a module in another program."
